{% capture intro %}
<p>I am Tom Hewitt (or "Chewitt" if youâ€™re feeling familiar), and I make things on the web. While I tend to dabble in all areas of web design and development, my area of expertise lies in Front End technologies. I work at Rareloop - a digital agency on the south coast of England - as both a Designer and Developer.</p>

<p>It's not always picnics and unicorns in the wonderful world that is "work". Sometimes you have to go out into the real world, and I try and spend most of that time indoors... probably watching some Netflix. I'm also a huge basketball fan (<a href="http://www.nba.com/bulls/" target="_blank">go Bulls!!</a>), nerdily into video games and eSports, and am way too enthusiastic about the Fast and the Furious franchise. Music and stories are my muses and I am an occasional and (not quite so anymore) secret <a href="http://www.brickish.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">AFOL</a> And I love pizza... like, LOVE it.</p>
