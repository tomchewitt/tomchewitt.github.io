<p class="headline">What started as a request to change a few backgrounds in-game turned into one of my staple projects while working with Square Enix; the mobile game Koozac.</p>

<p>Working on Koozac was a very enjoyable experience as it really allowed me to show my versatility across multiple disciplines. While originally I was only tasked with amending some in-game backgrounds to be less cluttered and overpowering, I ended up working on everything from logos and iTunes icons, in-game UI design, artworking new in-game assets, to web design and development.</p>

<p>The game owner Ben Cusack was so impressed that he asked me to rebrand his company <a href="http://www.viker.co.uk" target="_blank">Viker</a> and create the website.</p>
