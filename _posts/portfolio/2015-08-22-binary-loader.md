<p class="headline">Binary solo! One, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one...</p>

<p>This somewhat random loader is made using minimal markup and animated with pure CSS. I came up with the idea driving home from work, and an hour later it was finished. I was happy. It was done.</p>

<p>A couple of days later <a href="http://codepen.io/chriscoyier/">Chris Coyier</a> (the legend himself) gives me a cheeky follow on Codepen (you know, that thing HE built). As my good friend Ben put it: "That’s like Jesus following one of his Disciples". I couldn’t believe it! Better yet, my new pen makes it onto the homepage of Codepen as a top pick. I am extremely proud/humbled/excited retelling my story - please enjoy!</p>
