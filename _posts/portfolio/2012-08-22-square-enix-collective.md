<p class="headline">Square Enix Collective is a presentation and voting platform for showing off the best of Square Enix certified indie developers. I produced some branding and web design concepts for the initial idea behind the mechanic.</p>

<p>My role was to take the idea and form a cohesive user journey through the various phases of the platform. I also created some initial logo/key-art variations and site designs. The project ended up taking a different approach in design but I am still proud of my initial ideas.</p>
