<p class="headline">Having seen some truly spectacular uses of polygon art, I wanted to experiment a bit with it. And what better way to experiment than with a source photo of my beautiful wife Sarah.</p>

<p>I've seen people do this style of art in a few different ways. I chose to use Illustrator to overlay polygons onto the photo followed by adding black &amp; white gradients to each polygon, then switching into Photoshop to brush in some colour. Enjoy!</p>
