<p class="headline">Having been married for over a year now, I decided to make a special poster for my wife on our paper anniversary (because a poster is made from paper... right? right?). Using a photo from our wedding and the power of Illustrator (and a bit of colour enhancing in Photoshop) I created the below and had it printed. Enjoy!</p>


<div class="post-media">
	<ul>
		<li class="full"><img src="/asset/img/work/anniversary/01.jpg"></li>
		<li><img src="/asset/img/work/anniversary/02.jpg"></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="palette three-colors">
	<ul>
		<li class="color-1"></li>
		<li class="color-2"></li>
		<li class="color-3"></li>
	</ul>
</div>
