It finally happened... after endless procrastination and inefficient decision making - I have finally migrated my site to be powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and [GitHub Pages](http://github.com/pages "Github Pages").

Getting to grips with Jekyll and the liquid templating engine was made a very smooth process thanks to some easy, beginner's documentation. At work we have been using Twig and Timber in some of our Wordpress builds, which feels very similar to the Jekyll/Liquid syntax.

Github Pages as well was fairly breezy in it's setup. There's some fantastic documentation out there to help you get setup with your existing domain, and keep your emails still functioning. Github Pages also has great support for Jekyll, meaning it will compile down nicely into a static site for you - right on the Github servers.

There were a couple of caveats and complications I ran into using both Jekyll and Github Pages together. You need to keep the basic file structure for your Jekyll build or else Github won't be able to compile it. Making tag list pages takes a bit of work as Github Pages supports very few custom Jekyll plugins meaning you have to get a bit creative with it. I found this great article which goes through everything and works a treat.

## What's the point?

This new setup allows me to do something that I've been promising to do for months (read “years”)... write. I am now better setup to fill your minds with all of the wondrous wisdom I have collected thus far in my existence. Aren't you lucky :) I plan to focus on writing about my passions and experience in Design, Development and general techy-stuff but may veer into the world of gaming. Definitely expect a few random topics sprinkled here and there. If ever you'd like to discuss anything you see/read on this site - please get in touch through Twitter.

While this update has brought in some new features that I can take advantage of, it's missing the (rather dashing) ajax loader that was a big call out from my previous site. I do plan on rectifying this, eventually, and aim to try something a bit more streamlined and easier to expand - stay tuned.

## Keep dabbling!

All that's left for this post is to say thank you for reading - and your (hopefully) continued reading as I embark on this new adventure of wisdom sharing... Fear not, for I am extremely wisdomous so there will be plenty of reasons to come back and let the waves of intellectual power flow over you :)

Until then, keep dabbling, keep learning.
